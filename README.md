### What I learned

In this project, I tackled CSS Grid to manage the layout inside the `.card` component, arranging elements in a structured, grid-based format. CSS Grid is incredibly useful for designs that require a detailed arrangement of components across rows and columns, giving precise control over the layout.

I also utilized CSS Flexbox to efficiently handle alignments and space distribution within elements, particularly in sections like `.type-date` and `.avatar.` Flexbox is perfect for linear layouts—either horizontal or vertical—and it simplifies the process of spacing and aligning elements within a container.
